# Testing

During the project, I conducted testing for functionality and styling issues after building each section or Function/Model. Corrections or fixes were made before proceeding. Additionally, I enlisted friends to test the site by signing up, adding, and deleting comments using various devices and platforms (IOS, Android, Mobile, Tablet, etc.), and they reported any encountered issues with functionality or styling.

## Validation Testing

### HTML & CSS

HTML & CSS testing, I used [W3 Validator](https://validator.w3.org/)

error -----

## Python Testing

Python pep8 validation was done via [Code Institute's Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/)

The only issues encountered here were with indentations and the fact that certain lines of text exceeded the 79-character limit, but these have now been resolved.

Python Files Tested:

- models
- forms
- views
- urls

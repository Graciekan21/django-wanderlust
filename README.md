## Site Objectives

The main objective of this project was to design and create a blog site that showcases my growing understanding of the libraries and frameworks available to developers. Specifically, the three main objectives were:

- ### Create a responsive, readable,  and clean  front end

I aimed to develop a front end that is readable, clean, and responsive. My goal was to ensure the site is easily accessible and intuitively navigable for users. To achieve this, I utilized Django and Bootstrap to design and style the front end.

- ### Utilize the existing backend functionality

Leverage the functionality provided by the backend framework, enabling users to create profiles, comment on any blog posts within the site, and delete their own comments if desired.

- ### Store project data on an external cloud database

Store project data on an external cloud database. I utilized ElephantSQL to host the PostgreSQL database for this project.

# Design Choices

## Colour Scheme

The project's color scheme was derived from the colors featured in Code Institute's 'I think therefore I blog' walkthrough module. However, I have made numerous adjustments and enhancements to the styling and colors to align with my objectives. The scheme leans towards neutrality, with brighter colors reserved for actionable elements like buttons and links to facilitate navigation and site interaction.

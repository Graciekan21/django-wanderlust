## Site Objectives

The main objective of this project was to design and create a blog site that showcases my growing understanding of the libraries and frameworks available to developers. Specifically, the three main objectives were:

- ### Create a responsive, readable,  and clean  front end

I aimed to develop a front end that is readable, clean, and responsive. My goal was to ensure the site is easily accessible and intuitively navigable for users. To achieve this, I utilized Django and Bootstrap to design and style the front end.

- ### Utilize the existing backend functionality

Leverage the functionality provided by the backend framework, enabling users to create profiles, comment on any blog posts within the site, and delete their own comments if desired.

- ### Store project data on an external cloud database

Store project data on an external cloud database. I utilized ElephantSQL to host the PostgreSQL database for this project.

# Design Choices

## Colour Scheme

The project's color scheme was derived from the colors featured in Code Institute's 'I think therefore I blog' walkthrough module. However, I have made numerous adjustments and enhancements to the styling and colors to align with my objectives. The scheme leans towards neutrality, with brighter colors reserved for actionable elements like buttons and links to facilitate navigation and site interaction. 
I adjusted the color to my taste.

![Colour Scheme](documentation/images/color_scheme.png)

## Typography

The primary font utilized is font-family: Roboto, sans-serif; for the intro message while Puppies Play
was employed for the main logo text on 

## Logo and Favicon

The logo was crafted utilizing an online logo creator - [Favicon](https://favicon.io/)


## Wireframes

- Mobile Homepage Wireframe

## Testing

Please refer to [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file for all testing carried out.

### Solved Bugs 

| No | Bugs | How I solved the issue |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | As an admin, I unintentionally liked the blog posts I posted, which was not my intention | Hiding the ability for the admin to like and unlike blog they posted |
| 2 | I encountered issues with the slug while editing a post, causing errors whenever a user attempted to edit a post | I hid labels for specific fields using Style.css |
|3 | The logo and favicon were not appearing on the deployed site | The issue was resolved by removing "Disable collectstatic" from the Heroku config variable |
| 4 | I also encountered numerous indentation errors, excessive white space, and lines that were too long (81>79) characters while validating through pep8 | This was resolved by utilizing a formatting documentation for each file |
| 5 | My static files were not loading on the deployed site | 1. Deleted the CSS folder in the Cloudinary media library (NOT in Gitpod)
2.Compared my settings.py file to the CodeStar walkthrough settings.py file to ensure that it is set correctly 3.In the Gitpod terminal, re-run the collect static command: python3 manage.py collectstatic |
| 6 | I was getting a DisallowedHost error when attempting to view the site | I had to update the ALLOWED_HOSTS in settings.py by replacing it with the one shown on the error page |
| 7 | I encountered an error in the terminal caused by the Cloudinary version. I had to | I had to install pip uninstall cloudinary
pip install cloudinary==1.25.0
pip freeze > requirements.tx and the pip uninstall dj3-cloudinary-storage
pip install dj3-cloudinary-storage==0.0.5
pip freeze > requirements.txt, then run server and it worked as it should |

### known Bugs
On the Register page, I noticed some errors during validation, but they don't seem to affect the app, and none of the users have complained about anything. I believe they are caused by Django.

## Deployment

### Github Deployment

To store the website, I utilized GitHub for both data storage and version control. Here's how it was done:
After making any additions, changes, or removals of code, in the terminal within your IDE (I used Gitpod for this project), type:
- git add 
- git commit -m "meaningful commit message"
- git push

The files are now accessible for viewing within your GitHub repository.

### Creating a Fork or Copying

To clone/fork/copy the repository, you click on the "Fork" tab located next to the "Unwatch" tab in the top right corner of the page.


### Clone

To create a clone you do the following;

1. Click on the code tab, left of the Gitpod tab
2. To the right of the repository name, click the clipboard icon
3. In the IED open GitBash
4. Change the working directory to the location you prefer
5. Add Git Clone with the copy of the repository name
6. Clone has been created

### Repository deployment via Heroku

- On the [Heroku Dashboard](https://dashboard.heroku.com) page, click New and then select Create New App from the drop-down menu.
- When the next page loads insert the App name and Choose a region. Then click 'Create app'
- In the settings tab click on Reveal Config Vars and add the key Port and the value 8000. The credentials for this app were:

1. Cloudinary URL
2. Postgres Database URL
3. Port (8000)

- Below, click "Add buildpack" and select "Python" first, followed by "Node.js."

### Deployment of the app

- Click on the Deploy tab and select Github-Connect to Github.
- Enter the repository name and click Search.
- Choose the repository that holds the correct files and click Connect.
- A choice is offered between manual or automatic deployment whereby the app is updated when changes are pushed to GitHub.
- Once the deployment method has been chosen the app will be built and can be launched by clicking the Open app button which should appear below the build information window, alternatively, there is another button located in the top right of the page.

## Credits

This project was based on the Code Institute's - I think therefore I blog walkthrough module which provided a standard blog 'base'. From this base I customised a lot of the layout and styling with Bootstrap and custom CSS. I also added a custom model for Category. This allowed me to create a functionality within the site for users to filter the blog posts by a selected category.

I also added several custom Views and Forms to the site, as well as ensuring that all links and desired functionality was working as intended with no errors.

For inspiration and fine-tuning of my code, I referred to John Elder's youtube channel [Codemy](https://www.youtube.com/@Codemycom) where I was able to get a better understanding of how to correctly create this type of product using Django and Bootstrap.

The project guide and the readme layout was based on the example by [Kasia Bogucka - Portfolio Project 4 - The guide to MVP](https://youtu.be/vIv1c6RLBac?si=3pncBJmgvJ0tgBcd ) 

I also want to aknoledge My mentor [Jubril Akolade](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/ci_support/diplomainsoftwaredevelopmentecomm/mentor) for help me to understand the project approach and how to structure the readme with[ Sdalsosa- Readme](https://github.com/Sdalsosa/ComposerHub/blob/main/README.md)
 
The wireframe mockups were created using [figma](https://www.figma.com//)
After finishing, the README file was subjected to a spelling and grammar check using.

## Media

Using a stock image library like Pexels for placeholder images when none are uploaded to a blog post is a smart move. It ensures that your posts maintain visual appeal even when there's no specific image provided. Plus, it's convenient and saves time compared to creating your own placeholders. As long as you're still incorporating your original content and images throughout your blog, using stock images as placeholders shouldn't detract from your unique voice and style. It's all about striking a balance between efficiency and originality.
 All other content and images are my own.
